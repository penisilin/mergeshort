~ Solution of first question:

1.step: [16,21,11,8,12,22]

2.step: [16,21,11] - [8,12,22]

3.step: [16] - [21,11] - [8,12] - [22]

4.step: [16] - [21] - [11] - [8] - [12] - [22]

5.step: [16] - [11,21] - [8,12] - [22]

6.step: [11,16,21] - [8,12,22]

7.step: [8,11,12,16,21,22]

~ Solution of second question:
